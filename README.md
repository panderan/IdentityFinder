# Identity Finder

This project mainly uses the MSER algorithm and DRLBP feature to detect texts in the image, which contain some complex background or in the natural scene. Moreover, it uses Tesseract to recognize characters.

Identity is not only for a person but also for other things. For a person, identity information can come with an ID card, driver license card, and passport. For others, a road name can come with a street nameplate; a car's Identity can come with its vehicle license plate. In other words, Identity like one's name.

In the real world, there are too many thing's names in text format. We can extract them from images and better understand the picture.
